<p style="text-align: justify;">The magical thing about the web is that when you spend the money and then do the weird DNS things that take too long, you can make anything you want. The problem is you have to either have knowledge of HTML with the only experience being BBCode, WYSIWYG text editors, and&nbsp;<em>advanced&nbsp;</em>Inspect Element fiddling in school, or deal with some professional template that looks too nice and you don't get that rustic charm. Or there's a third option, a pitifully white and blank page with formatting options akin to some very old and obscure forum for a game that came out in 1993 and thirty-four people play.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">No, I did not <em>forget</em> about this, I was simply too lazy and wanted nothing to do with it after my excommunication. <em>Maybe</em> I'll fix it up and make it uglier, but <em>probably</em> I'll just keep it in limbo until <a title="Always assume incompetence over malice." href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/ScratchCat/">Big Daddy Scratch Cat</a> grants me salvation. Until then, I probably shouldn't update this website since it's technically communicating with the community when I'm not supposed to. This webpage should&nbsp;<a title="This is a link to one of my world renowned forum posts" href="https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/post/5222587">only be temporary</a>&nbsp;until something far more ugly and akin to the 90s or far more fancy shows up, but until now, this is certainly a website.</p>
